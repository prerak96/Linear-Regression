# Linear-Regression

Description -
This project utilizes linear regression to predict the prices of vehicles based on various features such as mileage, age, brand, model, etc. Linear regression is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm suitable for predicting continuous values, making it an ideal choice for this task.

Dataset - 
The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of vehicles with corresponding features and their prices. It encompasses attributes like mileage, age, brand, model, engine capacity, fuel type, and more. The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.

Approach -

Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features for predicting the vehicle prices.
Model Training: Implement linear regression using libraries such as scikit-learn in Python.
Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained model using evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Prediction: Utilize the trained model to predict vehicle prices for new data points.
